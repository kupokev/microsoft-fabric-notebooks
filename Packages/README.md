# Packages

This folder contains code to various packages.

## Instruction

1. Download the folder of code for the package you want to build.
2. Feel free to modify the packages to however you want. A shoutout in your code would be appreciated. 
3. Build the package with the code below. 

```
python -m build
```

This will create a subfolder called "dist" with two files in it. You should be able to upload either file to a custom Environment in Microsoft Fabric under the "Libraries" > "Custom" section.
